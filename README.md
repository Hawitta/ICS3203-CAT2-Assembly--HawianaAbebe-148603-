# Assembly Language Programs

This repository contains assembly language programs for various tasks. Below is a guide on how to run the assembly files using `nasm` (Netwide Assembler) and `ld` (GNU Linker) on a Linux system.

## Requirements

- **nasm** (Netwide Assembler): To assemble `.asm` files.
- **ld** (GNU Linker): To link the object files into executables.
- **Linux-based OS** (or a compatible environment like WSL on Windows).

You can install `nasm` and `ld` via your package manager if they are not already installed:

### For Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nasm
sudo apt install binutils


### For RedHat/CentOS-based systems:
```bash
Copy code
sudo yum install nasm
sudo yum install binutils
